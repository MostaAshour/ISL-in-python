# ISL-in-python
This repository contains solutions to exercises (Conceptual, Applied) from An [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, First Edition](https://www.statlearning.com/) By Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, writen in Python as Jupyter Notebooks.

You can find the statistic formulas in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) system in each notebook. Each chapter notebook contains an index for each exercise for easier navigation.

There are no official solutions for these questions. These are **my Own Answers** and may be inccorect. If you spot any mistake/inconsistency, I will be glad if you knock me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mosta-ashour/) or at mostaomg@gmail.com ðŸ˜Š

# To run notebooks:
- Running the notebooks enables you to go through and excute the code.
- Trying, modifying or adding new adjustments.
- Check/copy the Latex code for each presented formula.

**To run Locally:**
- [Install Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#). I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) which make it easier for installing different packages and environments. The software includes everything you would need to run the repository in a smooth environment.
